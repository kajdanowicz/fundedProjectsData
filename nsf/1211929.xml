<AbstractNarration>This award will provide continuing support for the operations of Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA), which operates an optical/near infrared interferometric array on Mount Wilson, CA.  Since beginning operations in 2004, CHARA observations have led to a number of new, fundamental measurements, including the first direct detection of gravity darkening on a single star, the first detection of hot exozodiacal dust around a main-sequence star, the first measurement of an exoplanets stellar host diameter and hence the linear diameter of its transiting planet, the first angular diameter for a low-metallicity star in the galactic halo, the first direct image of a short-period interacting binary, and the first image of a binary star system in eclipse.  With continued funding, the array will advance the development of optical and infrared interferometry the measurement of stellar angular diameters, which when combined with photometry yield effective temperatures and with parallaxes yield linear diameters.  Interferometry will also be used to measure stellar shapes, detect circumstellar disks and envelopes, and resolve binary stars to determine stellar masses and probe features of interacting systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a significant potential scientific impact in many areas of stellar astrophysics, the project will contribute to the training of the next generation of experts in the field of interferometry.  Data products and the techniques of interferometry will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at Georgia State University, and the research team will continue their efforts in informal education and public outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
