<AbstractNarration>Pathways to Mathematics (PTM) is a collaborative program between the University of South Alabama Colleges of Education, Arts &amp; Sciences, and Engineering, Bishop State Community College, and the Mobile County Public Schools System (MCPSS). PTM is addressing the need to increase the number of mathematics teachers in the MCPSS through enabling recent mathematics and engineering bachelor degree graduates to complete secondary mathematics certification in an intensive four-semester program that culminates with certification and an earned master's degree. The newly certified teachers (Noyce Scholars) are then participating in a two-year post-employment mentoring program designed to provide classroom support after graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PTM is preparing a total of up to 25 mathematics teachers (over the five-year period) certified to teach mathematics at the secondary level. PTM is doubling the number of math teachers who earn their certification from the University of South Alabama by creating a pipeline of undergraduate students beginning at the community college level and culminating in an earned master's degree and certification in secondary mathematics education. This project is expected to enhance middle and high school student achievement by providing certified mathematics teachers in high needs schools that currently lack certified math teachers.</AbstractNarration>
