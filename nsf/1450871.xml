<AbstractNarration>The StarLight Software Defined Networking Exchange (SDX) project focuses on research, development, and deployment of services, architectures, and technologies designed to provide scientists, engineers, and educators with highly advanced, diverse, reliable, persistent, and secure networking services, enabling them to optimally access resources in North America, South America, Asia, South Asia (including India), Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Africa, and other sites around the world. The StarLight SDX ensures continued innovation and development of advanced networking services and technologies. The facility supports continued research, development, experimental deployment, and trials of multi-domain SDXs and serves as an innovation platform on which to introduce next-generation services, architectures, policies, processes, and technologies, supported by persistent experimental research networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on three main activities: (1) development of an SDN Development Environment - the StarAX (StarLight Advanced eXchange) Innovation Engine - that enables facilities around the world to deploy SDXs that are compatible and interoperable with others; (2) deployment of an instance of this system at the StarLight facility; and, (3) coordination and collaboration with others around the world to deploy such systems at their exchange points. This project establishes an SDN Innovation Platform (software closely integrated with select hardware) to provide multiple network functions and features quickly and reliably. This StarLight initiative builds on prior successes of the StarLight International/National Communication Exchange Facility,  and operates a wide range of emerging services and capabilities, including those based on 100 Gbps channels, programmable networking, SDN, SDX techniques, and related innovations. Northwestern University, the University of California at San Diego, and the University of Illinois at Chicago are undertaking this project in partnership with other research organizations, advanced R&amp;E networks, and science communities around the world.</AbstractNarration>
