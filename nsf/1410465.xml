<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically underrepresented (URM) in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance (PNW LSAMP) includes the three state region of Washington, Oregon and Idaho.  Broadening participation in STEM is critical to the region's economic vitality given the significant number of STEM related industries and research initiatives.  PNW LSAMP partners are active contributors to state and regional STEM initiatives, and the strong partnership between alliance campuses has resulted in increased pathways to college, student success in STEM majors and access to undergraduate research experiences.  Since the inception of the alliance, degrees granted to underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM have increased 70%, far outpacing the overall increase of 21% on partner campuses.  PNW LSAMP is sustaining its foundational work and enhancing it with an emphasis on community college transfer and preparation for graduate study in STEM fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PNW Alliance will continue to implement best practices for engaging students in STEM including bridge programs, community-building and participation in undergraduate research.  The Alliance will strengthen its partnerships with eight community colleges to better facilitate community college student transfer to 4 year degree programs and their participation in undergraduate research.  The Alliance will expand the number of students exposed to information about STEM graduate study through an enhanced focus on graduate school preparation. Project goals include 1) increase the number of STEM bachelor degrees granted to URM students by 10% per year; 2) increase the percentage of bachelor degrees granted in STEM to URM students who transfer from community colleges to 40%, and double the number of degrees granted to URM STEM transfer students; and 3) provide workshops and services to ensure that 95% of LSAMP-affiliated students are exposed to information about graduate school preparation.  The knowledge gained through the partnership with MESA community college programs will allow PNW LSAMP to pilot and implement national models for engaging community college students in STEM as they are discovered.</AbstractNarration>
