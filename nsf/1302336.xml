<AbstractNarration>This project considers cellular systems based in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, between 30 and 300 GHz, where the available bandwidths are much wider than today?s cellular networks [4-6]. Indeed, available spectrum at these frequencies can be easily 200 times greater than all cellular allocations today under 3 GHz. Moreover,the very small wavelengths of mmWave signals combined with advances in low-power CMOS RF&lt;br/&gt;circuits enable large numbers of miniaturized antennas to be placed in small dimensions. These multiple antenna systems can be used to form very high gain, electrically steerable arrays, fabricated at the base station, in the skin of a cellphone, or even within a chip. Due to the limited range of mmWave signals, the proposal envisions cellular systems based on large numbers of mmWave ?picocells? (100 to 200m radius), each using highly directional antennas for improved range and spatial separation. Combining dramatically increased bandwidths with spatial multiplexing gains from the high-dimensional multiple antenna transmissions such mmWave picocellular systems offer the possibility of of 1000 times more capacity than current commercial networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a basis for bringing mmWave technologies to a multiuser, multi-cellular setting and enable mmWave systems for wide-area networks with mobility. With partnerships from leading device vendors in this space, the PIs aim to drive the innovation forward in terms of device and protocol development, and train a new generation of students at the graduate and undergraduate level in this emerging area of wireless communications. The enhanced throughput gains that could approach 1000x current wireless cellular network throughputs would revolutionize the wireless broadband industry and lead to improved delivery of network services to users.</AbstractNarration>
