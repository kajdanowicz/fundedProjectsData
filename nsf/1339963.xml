<AbstractNarration>The University of Rhode Island Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program is recruiting undergraduate STEM majors and STEM professional career changers who might otherwise not have considered a career in K-12 teaching and supporting them through their induction years. Specifically, this project supports 20 undergraduate STEM majors and 5 STEM professionals over 5 years. These scholars are being prepared to teach elementary, middle, and high school students in high-need school districts. In addition, 50 freshman and sophomores will be afforded paid summer internships in STEM education areas. This project collaborates with five Rhode Island school districts as well as non-profit organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project extends STEM teacher education in two ways, both having transformative intellectual merit. First, using a model based on the results of state K-12 science assessments, diverse and highly effective field placement sites are being selected. Secondly, the Purposeful Ongoing Mentoring Model is being implemented to train cooperating teachers as mentors for Noyce Scholars during student teaching. This model is also being implemented to support Noyce Scholars as new teachers during their first 3 years of teaching. Evaluative aspects of this project will address the factors influencing STEM majors and STEM professionals to enter K-12 teaching, factors influencing their interest in working in urban schools, and factors leading to successful internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides providing well-prepared STEM teachers for high-need school districts in Rhode Island, the broader impacts of this project center on advancing discovery and understanding of successful recruitment and teacher training in K-12 mathematics and science. Plans are in place for sharing significant findings via presentations and publications. This project also has implications for workforce development in Rhode Island, a state facing a significant economic transition and one in which STEM training and STEM teaching at the K-12 level are likely to play a significant future role.</AbstractNarration>
