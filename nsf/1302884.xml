<AbstractNarration>This Arctic Observing Network (AON) project will continue Beaufort Gyre Observing System (BGOS) operations begun in 2003 during 2013-2018 to document the unprecedented changes in sea ice and ocean parameters that are presently occurring in the Beaufort Gyre (BG) region. The BG is a unique circulation component within the Arctic Ocean physical environmental system reflecting a set of specific atmospheric, sea-ice, and oceanic conditions that have significant interrelationships with the Arctic-wide as well as global climate systems. We will continue measuring time series of temperature, salinity, currents, geochemical tracers, sea ice draft, and sea level using bottom-anchored moorings and shipboard measurements. BGOS moorings plus two Japanese moorings (at no cost to this project) will acquire precise data on the variations of the vertical distribution of seawater properties, bottom pressures, sea ice draft and surface waves (during open water conditions) at scientifically important sites within the BG system. Ship-based synoptic sampling covering the Beaufort Gyre will continue to be performed each summer in collaboration with scientists in Canada and Japan, with shared logistics expenses, to augment the year-round mooring measurements. Temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, barium, and 18O will continue to be measured and analyzed at standard locations along sections at 140W, 150W, ~ 75N and ~78N using a shipboard CTD/rosette to continue the long-term time series started in 2003. Samples that provide information on longer time-scales, such as CFCs and carbon tetrachloride, alkalinity, total CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon and tritium/3He, will be collected less frequently. Between CTD/rosette casts, expendable CTDs that profile to 1100 m depth will continue to be used to increase spatial resolution of the temperature and salinity fields. The proposed work will be coordinated with the basic elements of AON to enhance effectiveness and interconnections of observational activities, and the field program will continue to accommodate other AON and NSF funded projects when able.  Data will be made available on the project website with a metadata pointer in ACADIS.</AbstractNarration>
