<AbstractNarration>The overarching goal of this project is to create a sustainable effort, inclusive of curriculum components, international research partnerships, research abroad experiences for undergraduates, and scholarly inquiries, that will enhance the preparedness of undergraduate engineering and science students at Howard University to be globally engaged leaders upon graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the objectives to develop a systematic approach to preparing engineering and science students for global leadership through curricular and course reform; to establish sustainable research partnerships between Howard University engineering and science faculty and engineering and science faculty at international institutions that will allow for student participation on research projects abroad both virtually and in person; to conduct scholarly examinations of the project?s educational approaches to enhancing the cultural and global awareness of engineering and science students; and to serve as a model program for other institutions seeking to prepare globally engaged engineering and science students by widespread dissemination of the program?s research findings and implementation activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a cross-sectional research study takes a mixed-method approach to better understand the experiences and perspectives of African-American undergraduate students who participate in an international research experience. The study will identify the characteristics of various international research sites, identify factors that help students successfully navigate their international research experience, identify the broader impacts of the international research experience on students, and contribute to the scholarly literature on global engagement and culture.</AbstractNarration>
