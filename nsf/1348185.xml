<AbstractNarration>ICDP is an internationally managed and operated Earth Science research program. It addresses&lt;br/&gt;fundamental geoscientific problems of global significance and is undertaken by international&lt;br/&gt;teams of scientists at carefully selected sites around the world. ICDP serves the entire Earth&lt;br/&gt;Science community and is peer-reviewed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant progress has been made in recent years in the conceptual understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;highly complex 'System Earth' with its numerous subsystems. As a result, it has become clear&lt;br/&gt;that scientific drilling is an indispensible tool in our understanding of Earth processes&lt;br/&gt;and properties. Drilling provides the only means of obtaining direct information on processes&lt;br/&gt;operating at depth. It allows for determination of in situ-properties of solid materials and&lt;br/&gt;fluids and permits testing of hypotheses and models derived from surface observations, remote&lt;br/&gt;sensing data and laboratory experiments. In addition, drill holes may be used as a natural laboratory for experiments and as an observatory for long term monitoring of ongoing active processes. Earth drilling, therefore, plays a critical&lt;br/&gt;role both in scientific research directed towards improved understanding of the workings of our planet and in solving urgent societal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICDP support is based on the 'comingled funding' principle and international costsharing.  Each drilling project is independently organized in the form of a Joint Research Venture(JRV)between the ICDP and the Principle Investigator(s).  This award provides continued support for the U.S. participation in ICDP.</AbstractNarration>
