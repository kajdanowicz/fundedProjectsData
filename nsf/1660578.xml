<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.  The Madigadao Aru Maagigishki: Transformative Capacity Building Project aligns with this goal through its focus on enhancing and updating the environmental science (ES) and computer science (CS) degree programs at Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College (NHSC), using a variety of evidence-based strategies to recruit, retain and graduate students with these degrees. The project has the potential to increase the representation of Native people earning STEM college degrees and pursuing challenging STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Madigadao Aru Maagigishki project's goal is to enrich and expand STEM instruction as a means to increase NHSC students' completion of STEM degrees and entry into STEM professions.  Focusing on the disciplines of ES and CS, the project will enhance these degree programs by developing student learning communities, providing faculty-mentored summer research internships for students, incorporating significant cultural content and contexts into the curriculum, and engaging the college and larger tribal community in research symposia. Curriculum improvements will include employing evidence-based pedagogies such as problem-based learning in the study of STEM issues relevant to the tribal community. Local tribal elders will work closely with faculty members in revising their courses to include cultural content. Work on the college's CS program will emphasize updating the curriculum to meet the current demands of the field.</AbstractNarration>
