<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The investigators of this study propose to develop and study two sets of instructional materials for K-2 teacher professional development in mathematics and science that are aligned with the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  They will develop two modules in each subject area and an introductory module that prefaces and integrates the science and mathematics materials.  Teachers will be able to review the materials online, watch video of exemplary teaching practice, and then upload their own examples and students' work to be critiqued by other teachers enrolled in professional learning communities as well as expert coaches.  New instructional materials aligned with the standards are needed to assist teachers in meeting the challenging instructional practices recommended.  To date, scant few resources of this type exist and, given many school districts have limited resources, more cost-effective forms of development such as this must be found.  A particular strength of this project is that teachers will be able to engage in the courses online, on an ongoing basis and integrate what they have learned into their daily teaching practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose a program of design research to develop and improve the modules. The central hypothesis is a test of the Teaching Channel model--that the modules and professional learning communities result in significant changes in the quality of instructional practice.  Text analytics will be performed on the online discussion to detect changes in group discourse over time.  Changes in instructional quality and vision will be measured by observing the videos posted by teachers.  Pre-post tests of student work will be performed.  The findings of the research will be disseminated through conference presentations, publications, and the Teaching Channel website.</AbstractNarration>
