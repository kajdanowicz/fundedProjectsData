<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Utah Valley University (UVU), in partnership with two-year institution Snow College, will implement a Phase 2 project to assist high-need school districts in Utah schools with addressing a critical shortage in mathematics and science teachers. During the 5-year period, UVU will award 65 scholarships of $10,000 to approximately 45 talented juniors and seniors majoring in mathematics, biology, or earth science. Recruitment efforts will include high school students in concurrent enrollment programs and members of groups typically underrepresented as mathematics and science educators. Through a strong pre-service training and in-service support program focused on professional engagement, recipients will be well-prepared to teach in high-need school districts and inspire a new generation of students in mathematics and science disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will build on UVU's previous successful Noyce Scholarship program to increase the number of 7th-12th grade STEM teachers in Utah by: (1) providing scholarship support to additional cohorts of talented science and mathematics majors; (2) conducting longitudinal evaluation and research activities on previous and new cohorts of scholarship recipients; and (3) expanding outreach efforts to Snow College and to UVU's Community College Division. Program activities will focus around cultivating a community of teachers and scholars, including participation in state and national professional organizations through which novice teachers work with practicing educators to energize their efforts and help them succeed in their early years of teaching and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
