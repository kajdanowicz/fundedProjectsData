<AbstractNarration>The EarthScope science program supports geoscientific exploration of the North American continent to better understand what it is made of, how it was put together, how it works, and why processes like volcanoes and earthquakes take place.  Understanding the processes shaping the Earth is important for understanding potential hazards that may take place, as well as for characterizing what natural resources may exist.  The EarthScope National Office at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks serves a broad community of stakeholders, including researchers, teachers, students, decision makers, and the general public in facilitating and coordinating activities related to synthesizing and disseminating the scientific discoveries made through EarthScope. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EarthScope science program has had a long history of supporting research on the structure and dynamics of the North American continent.  The EarthScope National Office at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks will serve as the nexus for the EarthScope community through the next phase of the EarthScope program.  A major focus of this EarthScope National Office will be to help coordinate and facilitate synthesis of major outcomes from EarthScope research and education and outreach.  In addition to supporting community-derived synthesis activities, the Office will convene a series of synthesis workshops based on topics proposed by the community, and the outcomes of these workshops will be published on the website, as well as provide the foundation for review papers and special journal issues.  The EarthScope National Office will also serve the community through leadership and coordination of a variety of core functions.  The Office will continue to coordinate EarthScope-related activities with GAGE, SAGE, and SAFOD core repository personnel, including providing leadership of the EarthScope Steering Committee.  Another major focus of this EarthScope National Office will be outreach to both the EarthScope scientific community as well as to the broader public through an increased science writing portfolio and a more frequently updated EarthScope website.  Other EarthScope Education and Outreach activities that the Office will continue to support include the EarthScope Speaker Series, Newsletter, and biannual National Meeting.</AbstractNarration>
