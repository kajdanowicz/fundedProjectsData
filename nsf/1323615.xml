<AbstractNarration>The Global Soundscapes! Big Data, Big Screens, Open Ears Project uses the new science of soundscape ecology to design a variety of informal science learning experiences that engage participants through acoustic discovery  Soundscape ecology is an interdisciplinary science that studies how humans relate to place through sound and how humans influence the environment through the alteration of natural sound composition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) an interface to the NSF-funded Global Sustainable Soundscapes Network, which includes 12 universities around the world; &lt;br/&gt;(2) sound-based learning experiences targeting middle-school students (grades 5-8), visually impaired and urban students, and the general public; and&lt;br/&gt;(3) professional development for informal science educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project educational components include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- the first interactive, sound-based digital theater experience; &lt;br/&gt;- hands-on Your Ecosystem Listening Labs (YELLS), a 1-2 day program for school classes and out-of school groups; &lt;br/&gt;- a soundscape database that will assist researchers in developing a soundscape Big Database; and &lt;br/&gt;- iListen, a virtual online portal for learning and discovery about soundscape. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team includes Purdue-based researchers involved in soundscape and other ecological research; Foxfire Interactive, an award-winning educational media company; science museum partners with digital theaters; the National Audubon Society and its national network of field stations; the Perkins School for the Blind; and Multimedia Research (as the external evaluator).</AbstractNarration>
