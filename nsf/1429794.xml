<AbstractNarration>The funding of this proposal will support the development of a new high-resolution, high-sensitivity ion microscope to serve as the prime instrument of the UCLA/NSF national, multi-user facility for secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) research in the geosciences. The UCLA laboratory has served as a world-class facility for in situ microscale isotopic analyses of geologic materials for 18 years. The Principal Investigators will continue their programs of research training for graduate students (both at UCLA and elsewhere) and young postdoctoral scholars. In addition, they will continue their popular and effective outreach and inreach workshops for SIMS training of the next generation of geoscientists. The Principal Investigators and UCLA scientists and students continue to be involved in synergistic activities both locally and nationally, including professional activities and K-12 education and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central research tool of the UCLA National Ion Microprobe Facility has been the CAMECA ims 1270, the first commercial large-radius SIMS built by CAMECA instruments in consultation with UCLA scientists 23 years ago.  Although the ims 1270 has been upgraded over the years, it is no longer state-of-the-art, and in several important research areas the ability to innovate and to undertake new types of investigations is limited by the instrument's technical capabilities.  The PIs propose to partner with two instrument manufacturers (CAMECA, Oregon Physics) to develop a new ion microscope that will have (1) high brightness ion sources, (2) improved lateral spatial resolution, (3) improved mass resolving power, (4) improved throughput speed and sample capacity, (5) improved detector sensitivity and linearity leading to higher precision and accuracy in isotopic analyses, and (6) improved reliability. Although this development will be done cooperatively with two commercial entities, UCLA scientists and engineers will accomplish the overall design and implementation.</AbstractNarration>
