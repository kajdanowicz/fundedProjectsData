<AbstractNarration>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI, lead institution), the University of New Mexico (UNM), and Boston University (BU) are jointly proposing to establish an Engineering Research Center for Smart Lighting under the direction of Fred Schubert, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated research, education, and technology transfer of the Smart Lighting ERC will demonstrate revolutionary lighting systems for rapid diagnostic bio-imaging, high-efficiency displays, safer transportation, and novel modes of communication. The critical enabler for advanced lighting systems will be a new generation of smart light sources whose spectral composition, color temperature, polarization, spatial, and temporal modulation properties are fully controllable and tunable. Smart light sources&lt;br/&gt;and advanced lighting systems will result in tremendous benefits to society and humankind, including:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Fundamental advances in biotechnology for rapid and highly specific identification of cells.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Brilliant displays with high efficiency and large color gamut enabled by polarized emitters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased safety in transportation systems through the implementation of ambient intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Novel modes of communication, networking, and sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reduced pollution and global warming through energy-conserving, mercury-free lighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reduced dependency on sleep-inducing pharmaceuticals, reduced risk of cancer, and support of the natural circadian rhythm, thereby enabling higher productivity and a better quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These benefits will be realized through the systematic exploration and development of smart-lighting principles in three vertically integrated research thrusts: (1) novel materials, (2) device technology, and&lt;br/&gt;(3) system applications and impacts. As envisioned, the center will create a unique and focused program in which faculty and students from a wide range of disciplines come together with industry, government, and non-government agencies to work toward the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Conduct fundamental research to develop Smart Lighting. A strategic analysis has identified the critical attributes of future controllable light sources, and their underlying materials technology necessary to enable new and revolutionary functionalities that go far beyond present capabilities. At the device level,these attributes include polarization control, novel low- and high-index nanostructured materials, nanoepitaxial methods, photonic crystals, and novel types of phosphor distributions. These core innovations will be integrated into working devices and systems that are adaptable, controllable, and manufacturable. Testbed systems that use the devices will demonstrate advances in biomedical, display, transportation, and network communication technologies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Establish a multi-faceted, cross-disciplinary education and training program in Smart Lighting for students and professionals. The hands-on special education program Science You Can See, to be integrated with ERC educational materials, will increase the interest of a broad and minority-rich pre-college and undergraduate audience in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Rapidly transfer knowledge to the commercial sector and commercialize validated products. This will be achieved by working side-by-side with established firms and small startup companies in the concept,development, and validation stages of smart-lighting products. Providing industry with rapid access to key results while aggressively pursuing knowledge transfer and securing intellectual property.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Increase diversity through a focused effort to attract, educate, and advance women and underrepresented and disadvantaged minorities within the ERC pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate programs, and, ultimately, enable successful careers in Smart Lighting and related industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The ERC will establish a world-class program in Smart Lighting that will dominate scientific discovery and technological innovation in a new area of photonics. Research and education programs will lead to revolutionary advances in fields as diverse as biotechnology, display, transportation, and networked communications technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The ERC, through rapid commercialization, interactive education programs, and diversity outreach programs, will increase the competitiveness of US industry and make Smart Lighting products&lt;br/&gt;and benefits available worldwide. Additional key participation will come from strategic, corporate, and foreign academic partners. Training programs on entrepreneurship, intellectual property, marketing, and unintended consequences will create a culture of innovation and broaden the scope of research.</AbstractNarration>
