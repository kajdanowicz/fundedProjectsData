<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Root and Rhizobiome Innovation (CRRI) promises to break new ground in understanding of how plants interact with their environment via their root systems, with the goal of applying that knowledge to provide society with new technologies for more secure and resilient food systems.  The project is built upon an excellent statewide foundation of research facilities and expertise, while also making critical improvements to this research infrastructure.  Much of this knowledge will be made publicly available online.  The Center will be strongly integrated across many disciplines, involving scientists and engineers with expertise in plant systems, chemical ecology, and microbiology, among others.  In parallel with its research agenda, the project will continue several successful programs that provide outreach and workforce development opportunities aimed at improving the accessibility of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education throughout the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;The CRRI will employ integrated systems and synthetic biology approaches to investigate plant root metabolism and its interdependence on the near-root soil microbial community (i.e., the rhizobiome).  The genetic variability of maize lines will be studied in the context of their influence on root exudate production and in turn on the rhizobiome.  These results will be used to develop improved models to describe genetic influences on plant systems behavior and to drive the development of new engineered maize lines with improved responses to abiotic stresses.  The project will lead to improved understanding of the genetic diversity of plant roots and the rhizobiome.  It will also lead to technological advances toward the engineering of agriculturally vital crops.</AbstractNarration>
