<AbstractNarration>Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC), in partnership with Shawnee Community College (SCC), Boys and Girls Club of Carbondale, and over 12 high-need school districts in the region, is mentoring and preparing 20 Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) to transform science and math teaching in the partner schools. Through courses, leadership activities, research experiences and involvement with training pre- and in-service science teachers, MTFs are establishing a sustainable community of problem-solvers. MTFs are mentored by SIUC and SCC STEM faculty and educators in a synergistic endeavor to strengthen inquiry-based science experiences for teachers and students. As the principal agents for educational reform, MTFs are acquiring a deep grounding in science and mathematics content, inquiry-based learning methods, instructional interventions, and Action Research skills. They are developing leadership skills in designing and implementing professional development activities for their fellow in-service teachers in the region and for pre-service teachers. SCC is a key link in this partnership as most students at SCC attended the partner school districts and transferred to SIUC to complete their undergraduate degrees. Collaborating with researchers and IGERT fellows, MTFs conduct scientific research at the Cache River Natural Area and develop Problem-Based Learning (PBL) exercises and materials for a Resource Center housed at SCC. A virtual community is also being established using a course management system to disseminate resources and promote team communication. This community-based approach leads to inquiry-based instruction, especially problem-based learning, in the middle grades and improved student performance in science and mathematics at this critical juncture in education. MTFs conduct mentored authentic research, which they then translate to PBL exercises for their classrooms and the Boys and Girls Club of Carbondale, and disseminate to other teachers. IGERT Fellows mentor the MTFs and guide them in implementation of classroom activities. Additional pre- and in-service teachers are engaging in similar projects with their students or through a summer research experience. The focus on a widely studied and attractive natural area is designed to draw teachers, students and their families into "backyard" or community science projects. Additional professional development components of the program for MTFs include enriching science, leadership and science pedagogy courses, workshops and lectures in existing courses that MTFs will assist SCC and SIUC faculty in teaching, induction of novice teachers, development of a PBL Resource Center, shared maintenance of the web site, and National Board Certification to transform teacher leadership in their schools.</AbstractNarration>
