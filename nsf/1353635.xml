<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a commercially viable and affordable frequency domain spectral induced polarization (SIP) borehole logging instrument that collects data in fluid-filled boreholes over a wide frequency range with high accuracy/resolution. The SIP technique is a geophysical technology that offers unique information on the physical, chemical and biogeochemical characteristics of Earth materials not provided by existing geophysical logging tools. The opportunity exists to market the tool to the oil, mining and environmental industries, as technical constraints and economical limitations that previously prevented the technology from being commercialized can now be overcome. The primary research objectives are: [1] develop high-performance analog and digital signal processing hardware, software, signal processing algorithms, drive, sense and focusing electrodes; [2] engineer a watertight enclosure and integrate the components into a sonde deployable in a borehole; [3] test instrument performance in laboratory simulations and boreholes at field sites that represent a range of geological conditions. Anticipated technical results include exhaustive evaluation of instrumentation accuracy and spatial resolution by means of numerical and physical modeling and assessment of the behavior of the sonde under a variety of environments and configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies with private industries, government agencies and academia involved in resource exploration (petroleum, mineral and water) and environmental assessment. Borehole deployment of an SIP instrument will permit new information on the variation in the physical, chemical and biogeochemical properties of the Earth to be obtained from logging measurements. Enhanced scientific understanding in hydrogeology, environmental, oil, gas and mineral exploration, carbon dioxide sequestration and geotechnical fields will result from the rich information on variations in Earth properties retrieved with the instrument. Potential societal impacts relate to the contribution of the technology to: [1]  improved resource (petroleum, mineral and water) location and characterization; [2] enhanced long term monitoring of environmental systems in a minimally invasive manner, advancing the state of long term environmental stewardship; [3] improved characterization of Earth formations required by civil engineering disciplines. The availability of this instrument will have immediate and long-lasting commercial impacts in the environmental characterization and remediation sector, as well as in the petroleum, mineral and water exploration sector.</AbstractNarration>
