<AbstractNarration>The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) proposes to add four new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with strong background in digital forensics. The project will have an immediate impact on the information assurance and forensics capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with general computing and security skills. The city of San Antonio has a strong security sector in both industry and the government, which will offer outlets for student internships and provide support in the areas of research, education, and training. As a Hispanic Serving Institution, UTSA is uniquely situated to help address the shortfall of security expertise in the ranks of traditionally underrepresented groups and this potential is a unique aspect of this project. UTSA has a long and strong reputation in meeting the needs of its Hispanic students and is also reaching out to students in local Title 1 schools and local 2-year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is graduating skilled information assurance and forensics professionals with strong leadership skills and a commitment to public service. The students will serve as summer interns to gain practical experience and will join federal agencies or other eligible entities upon graduation. The community has a long history in cybersecurity including a strong cluster of computer security industry and UTSA has developed programs to support this important industry. The university was named the top cybersecurity program in the country in the 2014 Ponemon Institute Survey of IT Professionals.  The university received its DHS/NSA National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education designation in 2002; Center of Academic Excellence in Research designation in 2009; and the re-designation as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense with the focus area of Digital Forensics in 2014.</AbstractNarration>
