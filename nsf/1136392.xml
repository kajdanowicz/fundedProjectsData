<AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA) Noyce TF/MTF project, S2TLC: Supporting STEM Teaching and Learning through Communities, responds to the critical need for middle and high school teachers of science and mathematics through a collaboration among the UMA Department of Teacher Education and Curriculum Studies (TECS), the College of Natural Sciences (CNS) and College of Engineering (COE), local high-need middle and high schools in the Pioneer Valley of western Massachusetts (Springfield Public Schools, Holyoke Public Schools, Greenfield Public Schools and Mahar Regional School), and the Hitchcock Center for the Environment, a nonprofit organization focused on the professional development of teachers and the education of youth in the sciences.  The project is encouraging talented science and mathematics students and professionals to pursue teaching careers and develop a long-term commitment to teaching students in high-need secondary schools.  A dynamic and interactive community of 20 Master Teacher Fellows (MTFs) and 20 Teacher Fellows (TFs) are receiving  professional development, community support, licensure, graduate degrees/certificates and salary supplements while they teach in high-need schools. S2TLC is providing inservice secondary mathematics and science teachers (MTFs) with professional development in effective inquiry-based, place-based, and culturally responsive instructional practices and leadership and mentoring skills.  In collaboration with MTFs and partnership schools, the institution is revising and implementing an initial licensure teacher program for secondary mathematics and science teachers in order to better ensure their retention in the profession and successful instruction.  Virtual and face-to-face communities of practice provide MTFs, TFs and other teachers with support for effective instruction and lessen the traditional isolation of classroom teachers.  The project is developing mathematics and science content courses that integrate the use of cognitive technological tools to facilitate learning.  This project is creating a community of practice that grows over time to connect a wide range of stakeholders across districts to educate, challenge, and sustain teachers as leaders and community members. Through a network of teachers in urban and rural schools, it is expected to increase the understanding of how varying contexts impact the manifestation of changes in practice, as well as student experience of these practices.</AbstractNarration>
