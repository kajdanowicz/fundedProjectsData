<AbstractNarration>The School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) annually hosts collaborative research visits of one-semester or one-year duration by approximately 70 mathematicians.  This award annually supports visits for 18 postdoctoral fellows and 6 mid-career mathematicians, who join 45 or more other mathematicians supported by funds from other sources.  In first-rate academic facilities located in a peaceful setting with a minimum of distractions, the School provides this diverse community of scholars with an interactive environment rich in mathematical content and conducive to collaboration. The presence of nearby Princeton University adds to the breadth of mathematics that is available to IAS visitors.  Each year the IAS conducts a special program focused on a particularly exciting field of mathematics. The programs for the next three years will include "Univalent Foundations of Mathematics" (2012), "Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and Random Matrices" (2013), and "Algebraic Geometry and Hodge Theory" (2014).  Approximately one third of visitors come especially to participate in such programs.  The School is dedicated to furthering the education of its postdoctoral fellows and strongly encourages the participation of women and members of other groups under-represented in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School of Mathematics is devoted to supporting fundamental research at the highest level and to fostering mathematical talent.  It is led by eight permanent faculty members whose expertise spans a wide spectrum of mathematics.  The School is a center for new collaborations and new lines of research.  Junior mathematicians benefit from mentoring by faculty and from interactions with senior scholars.  Mid-career and senior mathematicians consolidate their research projects and explore new research directions.  A large fraction of this country's mathematical leaders are former IAS visitors.  The School's emphasis on a unified mathematical perspective and bringing together a diverse group of mathematicians has led to numerous unanticipated mathematical developments.  Historically, many of the most important developments in mathematics have originated at the IAS -- this is reflected, for example, by the numerous Fields Medalists whose work is connected with the IAS.  All IAS lectures are videotaped and are available to the public.</AbstractNarration>
