<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This study involves continued analysis of weather radar and observational data along three main focus areas: (1) documentation of supercell storm evolution including the physical processes that affect tornadogenesis and tornado evolution, (2) documentation of the observed low-level wind field and vortex structure in tornadoes, and (3) the expansion of a radar-based tornado climatology.  Given the difficulties in collecting the high resolution three-dimensional data sets necessary to understand tornadogenesis, tornado evolution, and tornadic wind field structures, the proposed work has the potential to advance our understanding of tornado-scale processes, especially in the limited number of cases where detailed surface-based observations are also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Accumulated over many years the previously collected data has produced a uniquely extensive set of tornado wind-field measurements.  The knowledge gained from this study is critically important given the inherent variability of individual cases on both the tornado and storm scales.  The collection (and analysis) of measurements of a statistically large sampling of tornadic storms is required to properly understand the dynamics involved.  This study will further expand the number of cases included in the tornado climatology previously developed by this team of researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This study will improve our knowledge of wind fields associated with tornadoes, using a large data set of field observations of these storms.  This knowledge will help refine conceptual models of tornado formation, dynamics and evolution.   This research is focused on answering long-standing questions relating to the formation of tornadoes and tornado vortex wind structure.  The research performed in this study will improve future storm-scale numerical weather prediction efforts.  The investigators will collaborate with several universities across the country, to infuse this new knowledge into the curriculum involved in the study of severe and tornadic storms.</AbstractNarration>
