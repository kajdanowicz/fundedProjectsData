<AbstractNarration>University of Hawaii proposes to support technical services on R/V Kilo Moana (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The proposal requests support for basic services and specialized services.  For basic services, they will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise on R/V Kilo Moana to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The Institution also supports some operations on the R/V Ka`imikai O Kanaloa (KOK), which is not a UNOLS vessel, but does support some federally sponsored research, including some for NSF.  As specialized services, they offer two towed seafloor mapping systems (HAWAII MR1 and IMI-30) for shallow- or deep-towed imaging and bathymetry, and they provide services to evaluate the quality of data from acoustic current profilers installed on UNOLS vessels as well as continue to support a flee-wide ADCP standardization and quality control oversight program.  The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
