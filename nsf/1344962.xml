<AbstractNarration>The training program in applied mathematics at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  is centered on large multi-scale nonlinear systems and the mathematical and numerical methods needed to analyze them.   Areas of application include problems from mathematical biology, optical properties of materials, oceanography, and combustion.  Essential components of this effort will be the introduction of emerging research methods into the curriculum and a much closer interaction with researchers outside mathematics.  This will enrich the educational and professional experiences of  students and postdocs, and this will make them strong researchers who are able to work on emerging real-world problems in science and engineering.  In addition to attracting more students into graduate study in mathematics, the goal is to also encourage and advance mathematical science students and postdocs so they successfully achieve their career goals.  In the process the principal investigators will develop a model program that involves integrating research, research-linked communication, mentoring, seamless transitions, and broad educational experiences. Included in this effort will be innovative recruitment and retention components, as well as careful management and assessment of the program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The core of the research training program in Applied Mathematics at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is mentored participation of students and postdocs in an interdisciplinary research team.  The group provides a mentored research environment that is designed so that creativity, invention, scientific communication skills, as well as professional leadership, are promoted and developed.  The program will also broaden significantly the educational and professional experiences of the participants as they will regularly interact with scientists and engineers, both theoretical and experimental, at other academic, industrial and government laboratory facilities. The activities that will be developed will reach a wide audience and combine research, mentoring and broad education experiences.  Specific examples are Applied Math Days, the mini-courses, and mini-symposia. Included in this effort will be innovative  curricular changes that will provide mentored transitions that will both increase the number of students interested in, and prepared for, graduate school in mathematics and which will also prepare graduate students and postdoctoral associates for careers in academia or industry.</AbstractNarration>
