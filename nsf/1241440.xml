<AbstractNarration>The new CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program offered by Marymount University in Arlington, VA educates undergraduate and graduate students in cybersecurity, preparing them for critical positions in the Federal Government. Students are taught and mentored by full-time faculty, with a research focus, and part-time faculty who are working professionals, including SFS alumni. The program focuses on inquiry-learning with students playing an active role in developing cybersecurity techniques in the lab and in performing cybersecurity service-learning initiatives for local non-profit groups. Marymount, with its proven record of recruiting and educating students from underrepresented populations, launches students in cybersecurity careers in the Federal Government.  The inquiry-based approach to learning strengthens analytical and critical thinking skills that are vital to professionals working in the Federal Government cybersecurity field. By focusing on specific non-traditional populations like veterans, minorities and women, and community college students, Marymount will contribute to broadening the pool of cybersecurity professionals in the federal workforce.  Additionally, Marymount faculty and students, drawing on long established bonds with local high schools, will expose younger students to the opportunities for future careers in cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SFS project involves the participation of Northern Virginia Community College.</AbstractNarration>
