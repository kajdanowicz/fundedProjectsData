<AbstractNarration>The University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) HBCU-UP project is designed to increase retention and persistence in STEM and strengthen student preparation for graduate school and the workforce. The project intends to build a strong foundation for incoming UVI STEM students through activities to increase pass rate in developmental courses and to increase student preparedness for Calculus by a Math Behind the Science Summer Bridge Program including course-taking in computer programming and mentoring and training of students to understand the expectations for success in STEM education and careers. Strategies selected to achieve these objectives resulted from a thorough literature review of evidenced-based practices and tailored for the specific context of the institution. Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL) will be employed as a strategy to increase pass rate in developmental courses. The project has specific targets for STEM retention and graduation rate increases. A comprehensive set of strategies to achieve the retention and graduation rate goals include creation and/or delivery of 1. A special STEM freshman development course, 2. Summer Sophomore Research Institute (SSRI), 3. Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE), 4. Academic year HBCU-UP Research Scholar (AHRS), 5. Faculty professional development in STEM student advising and mentoring, and 6. A STEM Resource Center.</AbstractNarration>
