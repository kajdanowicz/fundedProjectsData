<AbstractNarration>Boston University's Noyce Urban Science Scholarships (BoNUSS) program is providing 29 new scholarships to academically talented science majors.  The departments within the College of Arts and Science, the School of Education and several local high-needs school districts (including Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Quincy Revere and Somerville) are partnering to provide scholarships for 24 recent graduates with science degrees to return to BU and undertake the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT).  In addition, 5 new undergraduate scholars are being funded to complete their licensure program in one year and teach in surrounding high-needs districts.  The program follows the previously established model at BU shown to be successful with students majoring in mathematics.  Pre-service teachers are exposed to a curriculum enriched with information and guest lecturers that address challenges faced by in-service teachers serving in urban settings.  In addition, following their practicum year, project personnel are offering continuing support for the new teachers including access to a Master Teacher who offers monthly seminars intended to address issues of classroom management, and conducts regular online sessions to provide support, advice, mentoring and help with curricular challenges encountered by new teachers.  The evaluation of the Noyce BoNUSS program also is identifying strategies that lead to the creation of an effective science preparation program to attract, prepare and retain high-quality secondary STEM teachers.</AbstractNarration>
