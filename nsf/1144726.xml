<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award facilitates the unique interdisciplinary training of Ph.D. scientists and engineers in the field of biotechnology by elucidating how cells interact with specifically designed environments based on a broad understanding of changes in the molecules within cells. Trained students will be ready to address a wide range of problems facing society, from agriculture and energy to human health and medicine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This program addresses this challenge by focusing on two areas of importance in biotechnology: cells' behaviors based on growth in a variety of environments; and "systems biology" - the integrated analysis of numerous molecular changes, particularly those related to gene expression, that occur within cells when exposed to different environments. A key feature of this work is that the environments will be specifically engineered. For example, different materials will be used to support the growth of a particular type of cell. By studying the impact of these controlled environments on the expression of the cell?s genes, one can begin to design strategies to target specific environments for specific applications: growth of cells as tissue replacement for healing, and design of better ways to deliver medicines, among others. The cross-training effort synergizes diverse areas of expertise available at the University of Delaware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This program addresses a critical question related to biotechnology research: how do molecular changes within a cell relate to the environment in which the cell is exposed? There are many important application areas and our program will provide students with an opportunity to learn critical experimental and computational techniques to best prepare them for careers in the life sciences industry. An emphasis on innovation will provide students with an opportunity to engage in industry internships and public policy, intellectual property workshops, as well as research experiences at institutions around the world. We will work to develop programs that broaden minority participation at multiple levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
