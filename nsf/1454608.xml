<AbstractNarration>Brief Description of Project Goals&lt;br/&gt;This research effort explores ultrasensitive magnetic sensing technology to enable applications such as point-of-care disease diagnoses and wearable medical sensors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching objective of this research is to enable a new generation of ultrasensitive biomolecular sensors for mobile health (mHealth) and wellness applications. The proposed project will have a transformative effect on the healthcare ecosystem by: 1) Empowering individuals and trained professionals with the necessary equipment to quantitatively diagnose diseases at the point-of-care. 2) Allowing diseases to be diagnosed earlier due to the ultrasensitive nature of the device, which will ultimately lead to better treatment outcomes and reduced costs. 3) Providing a means for preventative healthcare with increased portability and wireless infrastructure, as well as the ability to track therapy and disease progression. 4) Enabling low-cost diagnostic platforms for resource-limited settings, such as developing countries, helping to democratize healthcare. This CAREER proposal describes a synergistic research and education plan that will support the PI in progressing towards his career goals. The education plan includes components that target pre-college, both undergraduate and graduate students, and emphasizes inclusion of students from underrepresented minority groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past fifteen years, several different types of magnetic sensors have been used to detect biomarkers (proteins, nucleic acids, and cells) labeled with magnetic tags. The most sensitive of these are the same sensors used in nearly every hard disk drive today, magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) sensors. While MTJ sensors surpassed giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors in hard disk drive read heads nearly a decade ago, they have yet to make a substantial impact as biosensors due to manufacturing challenges and substantially higher noise, despite the increased transduction efficiency (10-50x higher than GMR sensors). The proposed research addresses these issues and makes progress towards mHealth point-of-care medical diagnostic and monitoring platforms by addressing the underlying research challenges. Namely: 1) Integration of MTJ biosensors with the associated electromagnet on the same chip, 2) Transduction based on temporal magnetic signatures afforded by the tight integration of the magnetic biosensor and electromagnet, and 3) Development of a novel flicker noise and temperature dependence removal scheme. The results from this research will provide a pathway towards ubiquitous, wearable and point-of-care biomolecular sensors. To demonstrate the advancements, two mHealth platforms are proposed: one for point-of-care diagnosis of cardiac biomarkers for acute myocardial infarctions in an ambulatory setting, and the other a wearable biosensor for continuous, long-term wound monitoring.</AbstractNarration>
