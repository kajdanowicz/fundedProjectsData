<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 April 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1219328&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO)&lt;br/&gt;PI:   B. Appelgate&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  Z. Kelety&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests CY 2012 operational funding support for the West Coast Winch Pool which is managed by Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The West Coast Winch Pool is located at SIO's Marine Facility in San Diego, CA.  The West Coast Winch Pool supports federally-funded oceanographic research by providing properly outfitted and maintained portable winches of all types (light-duty to full ocean depth) to the Academic Research Vessel Fleet.  Pooling of portable capital equipment such as this (1) provides "Centers of Expertise" with logistical support for science and ship operators; (2) provides equipment that is "Free at the Point of Use" to NSF-funded users which relieves burden on science and ship operations grants; (3) provides a mechanism for non-NSF funded users to share maintenance costs by paying established daily rates; (4) reduces the need for duplication of equipment at multiple institutions which results in a long-term cost savings to the federal agencies; (5) generates improved budget transparency on actual costs to operate and properly maintain capital, shared-use equipment; (6) allows NSF to make proper equipment purchase decisions based on science needs and provide the appropriate, dedicated, long-term support budgets; and (7) improves the quality and reliability of equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The research projects supported by the equipment pools have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit with all equipment deployments coordinated with University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ship time requests.  SIO also operates the MELVILLE, REVELLE, NEW HORIZON and SPROUL.   These vessels support federally-funded scientific research throughout the world's oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  SIO participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events, student tours, and hosting of government officials, dignitaries, and science communities while in foreign ports.</AbstractNarration>
