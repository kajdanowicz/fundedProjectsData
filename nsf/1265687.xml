<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research and pedagogical activities of Prof. Mahesh K. Lakshman at The City College and The City University of New York. Professor Lakshman's research involves the chemical modification of nucleosides and purine derivatives as well as closely related heterocycles, using catalysis methodology. Studies are conducted on metal-catalyzed carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond-formation methodologies. There are several aims of the research: chemoselective and room-temperature transformations of nucleosides, design of new ligands for modulation of catalytic conversions, development of benzotriazolyl nucleoside analogues, and use of pyrimidine, quinazoline, and purine as potentially disposable handles for functionalization of organic molecules.  Professor Lakshman collaborates with researchers at several national and international institutions  to access the activity of the new nucleosides and related heterocycles created as part of this project.    The research has various levels of complexity and students at all educational levels participate in the program. In addition, this research has led to opportunities for outreach to local schools and colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal-catalyzed reactions offer a state-of-the-art approach to assembling complex molecular structures, often not accessible by other means. Nucleosides and purines are highly important biomolecules with applications in biochemistry, biology, and medicine. Metal-catalyzed reactions of nucleosides and purines allow for ready diversification of these biochemical scaffolds and provide access to previously unknown molecular architectures.  Metal catalysis also offers access to molecules that resemble nucleosides, and the intrinsic chemical reactivity of purines and related heterocycles can potentially be exploited in new ways.  New nucleosides and related heterostructures that are produced as part of this research are evaluated at several schools of pharmacy and medical institutions as potential anti-viral or anti-HIV medicines as well as treatments for cardiovascular disease and cancer.  Students at various educational levels, including those from local middle and high schools and colleges, gain training in contemporary chemistry and professional preparation by participating in this research project.</AbstractNarration>
