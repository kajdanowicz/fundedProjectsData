<AbstractNarration>FULL STEM, a Type 1, Phase 1 Noyce project, is a five year teacher preparation program leading to the production of 33 new science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) teachers prepared to teach in high needs schools. Noyce Scholars graduate with a major in a STEM field and a Master of Science for Teachers (MST) in Adolescence Education degree or a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree in a STEM field. The program includes: teaching internship opportunities for undergraduates; two undergraduate courses in science and math learning including a field specific teaching component specifically designed for the needs of the Noyce Scholars; National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) certified and clinically rich MST and MAT programs; extensive mentoring by teacher-scholars prior to and throughout the masters programs. The project supports teachers during their early years of teaching by providing continuing mentoring by teacher scholars, workshops to address challenges encountered by new teachers, online resources for discipline specific teaching, and a discussion board for continuous interfacing with other teachers and Noyce personnel. The program is a partnership between SUNY Oswego College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and School of Education faculty, eighteen local community colleges (Onondaga, Jefferson, Cayuga, Tompkins County, Monroe, Hudson, Mohawk Valley, Broome, Clinton, Columbia-Greene, Corning, Finger Lakes, Genesee, Hudson Valley, Jamestown, Adirondack, North Country, and Niagara County), Syracuse and Oswego school districts, Beaver Lake Nature Center, Rice Creek Field Station, and Rosamund Gifford Zoo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This program, by recruiting STEM undergraduates or holders of STEM degrees, and providing them with financial support to complete their masters degrees in teaching in an environment that supports their development into  highly qualified dynamic teachers, is helping high need schools offer enriched STEM experiences to the many worthy students they serve.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The program can be emulated by other institutions with strong science and math teacher education programs. The interaction between the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the School of Education models the type of collaboration needed to produce STEM teachers who combine a love of their discipline with strong pedagogy skills.</AbstractNarration>
