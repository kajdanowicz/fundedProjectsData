<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the pace&lt;br/&gt;of research and development to enable more rapid deployment of technologies&lt;br/&gt;into commercial / industrial contexts. In many fields, information is expanding at&lt;br/&gt;such an exponential rate that finding relevant results to technical knowledge&lt;br/&gt;searches is increasingly difficult. Further, content is expanding so fast that most&lt;br/&gt;fields are rapidly forming sub-disciplines, leading to the ?silo-ing? of different&lt;br/&gt;knowledge sub-domains, a clear challenge to both academia and industry. We&lt;br/&gt;need ever better ways to organize and present information to users. There are&lt;br/&gt;disadvantages of the current search engines, mostly relating to excessive&lt;br/&gt;similarity in search results. Further, while these engines present information&lt;br/&gt;relating to a known search target, they are less effective at presenting&lt;br/&gt;unexpected results for information that a user has never heard of but that would&lt;br/&gt;be useful. What is therefore needed is an exploration system giving searchers a&lt;br/&gt;strong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results from diverse,&lt;br/&gt;unexpected, and potentially provocative sources. This will break down silos by&lt;br/&gt;providing a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. This system has been designed&lt;br/&gt;to provide a means for systematic, automated discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on&lt;br/&gt;optimizing and scaling a serendipitous document search system for repurposing&lt;br/&gt;technologies by analogy into lateral fields. Both by sub-parsing discrete content&lt;br/&gt;into ontologically separable entities, such as capability, characteristic, and&lt;br/&gt;composition, and by comparatively assessing certain of these attributes between&lt;br/&gt;such entities, the attribute relatedness of these entities can be used to drive their&lt;br/&gt;self-assembly into related attribute networks. This approach provides a&lt;br/&gt;significant value proposition for drug repurposing, which is the current focus of&lt;br/&gt;this project. To scale the pair-wise comparison and network assembly of millions&lt;br/&gt;of documents, a map-reduce based text-processing framework will be developed&lt;br/&gt;so that massively parallel computations can be carried out in a time- and costefficient&lt;br/&gt;manner. A distributed search engine technology will be deployed to&lt;br/&gt;enable rapid querying of the emerging document relationship network. A series of&lt;br/&gt;machine learning algorithms will then be used to determine potentially hidden&lt;br/&gt;structural architectural features within the document relationship network.&lt;br/&gt;Machine learning will elucidate the nature of the relationships in drug networks&lt;br/&gt;through analyses of inter-node relationships and sub-graph motifs (termed&lt;br/&gt;?innovation motifs?). Documents including U.S. patents and scientific papers will&lt;br/&gt;be processed in the system.</AbstractNarration>
