<AbstractNarration>This award will support the URI Graduate School of Oceanography Marine Office in its ongoing efforts to operate R/V Endeavor in support of our nations oceanographic science community for CY 2012. R/V Endeavor has had a 35-year record of efficient, safe, and flexible ship operations combined with a commitment to invest in the future. This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and funding for each year of the agreement will be negotiated and is dependent on the number of days at sea in support of NSF-funded research. R/V Endeavor operates as a UNOLS ship, adhering to the UNOLS safety standards, and NSF inspections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical merit, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2012 R/V Endeavor will take four NSF sponsored research programs to sea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These peer-reviewed projects supported by operations on R/V Endeavor in 2012 have been rigorously evaluated for scientific and intellectual merit as an integral part of the NSF grant review and award process. The competitive nature of the award granting process ensures a very high level of intellectual merit. Knowledge gained and the discoveries made by the research programs supported by R/V Endeavor will enhance understanding of the oceans and address a broad range of important scientific questions. The goal of this proposal is to provide funding support to safely and productively operate and maintain R/V Endeavor in 2012 and to ensure it is maintained to support its planned life-cycle. This support is an essential prerequisite for safe and successful scientific missions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boarder Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The State of Rhode Island-supported RI Endeavor Program provides Rhode Islanders with direct access to the scientific research and educational capabilities of RV Endeavor. As part of the RI Endeavor Program, educators are provided &lt;br/&gt;The Rhode Island Teacher At Sea (RITAS) Program, designed by the Office of Marine Programs (OMP), establishes sustainable partnerships among ocean scientists, researchers and teachers who live and teach in Rhode Island. Teachers selected for the RITAS Program will become part of a scientific research team conducting ocean science research while cruising aboard the RV Endeavor. &amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;All K-12 educators of Science, Technology, Art, Math, English and History are invited to apply. There is no application deadline. &lt;br/&gt;GSO is unique in the breadth, success, and national and international reputation of its public service and outreach programs. Four groups at the Narragansett Bay Campus are actively engaged in concerted public service and outreach efforts: the Coastal Institute (CI), Coastal Resources Center (CRC), Office of Marine Programs (OMP), and Rhode Island Sea Grant (RISG).</AbstractNarration>
