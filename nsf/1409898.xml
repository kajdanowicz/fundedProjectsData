<AbstractNarration>Structural dynamics and domain reorientation of a phosphohexomutase:  long range effects and catalysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigators will address fundamental questions about the functions of enzymes, the intricate molecular machines found in all living things.  In particular, this work will define pathways used for transmitting information across the three-dimensional structures of enzymes.   The program will train young scientists in powerful, state-of-the-art biophysical methods and their applications for unraveling the mysteries of biological macromolecules.  The research and associated training activities in this project will benefit the chemical and biotechnology industries in the U.S., as well as the research communities in protein science and biophysics.  The PI will expand her Science ARTreach program at a local elementary school, using art to improve science literacy of a diverse student population.  The co-PI will launch Scoutreach to introduce molecules of living cells to adolescent youth and will enhance teaching of biophysical methods in the graduate student curricula, to provide highly skilled employees for the work force.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Catalytically relevant motions among domains and in internal networks will be investigated in the enzyme phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM).  PMM/PGM is a member of a large enzyme superfamily whose members have important roles in carbohydrate biosynthesis.  Previous studies showed that both phosphorylation and ligand binding affect the structure and flexibility of this enzyme.  As phosphorylation and allostery are topics of wide interest, the mechanisms involved in long-range phospho-regulation of catalysis have implications for understanding many enzyme systems.  Specifically, this will be investigated at the levels of fluctuating domain orientations and networks of communicating and mobile residues, using a combination of cutting-edge X-ray crystallography, NMR, and protein chemistry.  Multiple enzyme states (phosphorylated, dephosphorylated, etc.) will be characterized in terms of the nature and populations of their side chain and domain conformers, their dynamics, and residue networks of transmission and dynamics. How these characteristics are affected by covalent phosphorylation vs. noncovalent ligand binding will be compared and contrasted. This will provide a comprehensive case study of long-range communication in an enzyme, and its tuning by phosphorylation and ligand binding.</AbstractNarration>
