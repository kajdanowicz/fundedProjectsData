<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The University of Rhode Island (URI) will establish the Consortium for Coastal Ecology Assessment, Innovation, and Modeling (C-AIM) to coordinate research, education, and workforce development across Rhode Island (RI) in coastal marine science and ecology. C-AIM addresses fundamental research questions using observations, computational methods, and technology development applied to Narraganset Bay (NB), the largest estuary in New England and home to important ecosystem services including fisheries, recreation, and tourism. The research will improve understanding of the microorganisms in NB, develop new models to predict pollution and harmful algal bloom events in NB, build new sensors for nutrients and pollutants, and provide data and tools for stakeholders in the state. Observational capabilities will be coordinated in an open platform for researchers across RI; it will provide real-time physical, chemical, and biological observations ? including live streaming to mobile devices. C-AIM will also establish the RI STEAM (STEM + Art) Imaging Consortium to foster collaboration between artists, designers, engineers, and scientists. Research internships will be offered to undergraduate students throughout the state and seed funding for research projects will be competitively awarded to Primarily Undergraduate Institution partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;C-AIM will employ observations and modeling to assess interactions between organisms and ecosystem function in NB and investigate ecological responses to environmental events, such as hypoxia and algal blooms. Observations of the circulation, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem will be made using existing and new instrument platforms. The Bay Observatory ? a network of observational platforms around NB - will be networked to trigger enhanced water sampling and sensing during specific environmental events, such as hypoxic conditions or phytoplankton blooms. Biogeochemical, ecological, and coastal circulation models will be integrated and coupled to focus on eutrophication and pollutant loading. Data and models will be integrated on multiple scales, from individual organisms and trophic interactions to food-web responses, and from turbulence to the regional ocean circulation.  New sensing technologies for nutrients and pollutants will be developed, including affordable, micro-fluidic (Lab-on-a-Chip) devices with antifouling capabilities. The results will be synthesized and communicated to stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
