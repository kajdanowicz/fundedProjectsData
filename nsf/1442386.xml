<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1442386, Principal Investigator: Nassif Ghoussoub &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Established in 2003, the Banff International Research Station (BIRS) is a North American research institute that addresses the imperatives of collaborative research and cross-disciplinary synergy, by facilitating intense and prolonged interactions among mathematical scientists from around the world. BIRS unique infrastructure ensures a creative environment for the exchange of ideas, knowledge, and methods within the mathematical sciences and their vast array of applications in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BIRS embraces all aspects of quantitative and analytic research. Its programs span almost every aspect of pure, applied, computational, and industrial mathematics, as well as statistics and computer science. Its workshops involve physicists, biologists, engineers, economists, and financial analysts. BIRS main mode of operation is to annually competitively select and run 48 weekly workshops, each hosting 42 researchers. The extraordinary response to the opportunities at BIRS leads to extremely high quality workshops.  This award supports the participation of more than 4,200 US-based mathematical scientists in the stations activities for the period 2016-20.</AbstractNarration>
