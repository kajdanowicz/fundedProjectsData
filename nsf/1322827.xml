<AbstractNarration>This full-scale project in Maine proposes to derive and develop an educational model for informal science learning in rural areas where ISE venues are non-existent. Should the project be successful, it could serve as a model for other rural areas in the Nation. The target group is youth 10-18 years of age and the content of the endeavor will vary based on the locality. Partners include the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance;  4-H; Cornerstones of Science libraries; the University of Maine, EDC for evaluation; and local industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will divide the state into small areas that will be designated as mini-networks. Each mini-network will have more than 1000 eligible students, a network leader, STEM guides, and volunteers. The geographic area will be small so that face-to-face interactions will be facile. Each site mini-network) will derive its own emphases depending on local expertise and industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rural education is an issue in this country that needs solutions for both its youth education as well as its public education. Often these regions are underserved in many ways, including formal education and economic opportunities, leading to a vicious spiral for residents. So, this project will essentially be a pilot project to work out the issues for a broader implementation across the country. Several thousand youths will be impacted across the state. Exposure to the informal STEM learning should be reflected in enhancement of the general knowledge base and academic improvement among the 10-18 year old population, the communities, and the formal education sector.</AbstractNarration>
