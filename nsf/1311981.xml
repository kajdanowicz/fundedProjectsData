<AbstractNarration>The Innovation Institute: From Problem to Product (I2) takes high school students through the entire process of inventing a device, software or other technology. This proposal makes use of a Makerspace at the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), which is located in a community with a high proportion of both immigrant and low-income residents. I2 builds on NYSCI experience with the Maker movement and leverages its Explainer program (where high school students who work as exhibit or program facilitators) by providing: 1) a product prototype/design program for high school Explainers and 2) afterschool and Saturday activities for middle school students, with mentoring provided by the Explainers. It will serve a total of 60 high school students (20 in each cohort) and 1000 elementary and middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a quasi-experimental design, the project evaluation addresses these questions: &lt;br/&gt;1. Does engaging in the process from design to product, emphasizing entrepreneurship, engineering, and the use of technology, lead to Explainers':  Deeper learning and 21st century skills?; STEM and ICT knowledge, skills, dispositions?; and Persistence in the STEM workforce? &lt;br/&gt;2. Does transferring the learning to younger students lead to deeper learning on the part of the Explainers (transfer and self-regulated learning), increased knowledge of the engineering process, and increased knowledge and skills in using technologies? &lt;br/&gt;3. Does participating in design-based activities increase middle and elementary students' positive attitudes, engagement and interest in STEM and STEM careers and lead to the perception of Explainers as role models? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will disseminate a replication handbook for scaling up the model and project evaluation reports. Project results will be further disseminated through articles submitted to peer-reviewed academic journals, workshops presented at museum conferences, and articles in other publications such as Make Magazine, a publication that targets those in the Maker movement.</AbstractNarration>
