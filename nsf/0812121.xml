<AbstractNarration>ERC for Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) Systems&lt;br/&gt;Alex Q. Huang, Director&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina State University, Arizona State University, Florida State University,&lt;br/&gt;Florida A&amp;M University, University of Missouri-Rolla&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Our vision for the ERC for Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management&lt;br/&gt;(FREEDM) Systems is an efficient electric power grid integrating highly distributed and scalable&lt;br/&gt;alternative generating sources and storage with existing power systems to facilitate a green&lt;br/&gt;energy based society, mitigate the growing energy crisis, and reduce the impact of carbon&lt;br/&gt;emissions on the environment. We believe the key to solving the energy crisis is not necessarily&lt;br/&gt;the renewable energy itself, but the infrastructure needed to deliver and manage large scale&lt;br/&gt;distributed renewable energy resources (DRER).&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the ERC for FREEDM Systems is to develop the fundamental and enabling&lt;br/&gt;technology to demonstrate the system and, through such development and demonstration,&lt;br/&gt;foster a revolution in innovation and technology in the electric power and renewable energy&lt;br/&gt;industries, providing long-term energy security and environmental sustainability for the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;Key Goals:&lt;br/&gt;Develop the fundamental knowledge base for the FREEDM system and provide fundamental&lt;br/&gt;breakthrough technology in energy storage and power semiconductor devices. Develop enabling technologies for subsystem and system demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;Develop a 1MW FREEDM green energy hub system to power the ERC headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;Develop a diverse group of adaptive, creative, and innovative graduates who advance&lt;br/&gt;fundamental knowledge, enabling technology and engineered systems innovations in&lt;br/&gt;renewable electric energy delivery and management systems&lt;br/&gt;Develop long-term partnerships with middle and high schools, teachers, and students to&lt;br/&gt;enhance engineering content knowledge and pedagogical methods, bring engineering&lt;br/&gt;concepts into the classroom, involve pre-college students in research, and thereby increase&lt;br/&gt;the diversity and enrollment of domestic students in university engineering degree programs.&lt;br/&gt;Form long-term partnerships with large and small firms to speed the translation of ERC&lt;br/&gt;research into commercially viable products, stimulate formation of start-up companies based&lt;br/&gt;on ERC intellectual property, and involve students in all phases of the innovation process.&lt;br/&gt;Increase the diversity of the proposed Center?s leadership, faculty, and students to exceed&lt;br/&gt;academic engineering-wide national averages within the first five years of operation.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In addition to social, economic, and market challenges to be addressed&lt;br/&gt;by the ERC and by the power industry as a whole, barriers include needs for: new system&lt;br/&gt;theory for the paradigm-shifting FREEDM system; new high-frequency high-voltage power&lt;br/&gt;electronics based on wide bandgap materials; and significantly higher energy density storage&lt;br/&gt;technologies. Innovative development of such an infrastructure cannot be expected to occur in&lt;br/&gt;todays centralized model, where power companies seek only incremental solutions and&lt;br/&gt;research investments are suppressed to maximize profits. The systems approach required&lt;br/&gt;cannot be expected to occur through individual research projects with no common standards or&lt;br/&gt;test bed. To develop the FREEDM system, a multidisciplinary center of excellence is needed to&lt;br/&gt;pull together our nation?s top expertise in energy system theory, policy, renewable energy&lt;br/&gt;technology, energy storage technology, electronic devices, and communication.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts include an increasingly diverse and innovative pool of U.S. engineers;&lt;br/&gt;mitigation of global warming; aversion of an energy crisis; innovation in renewable energy&lt;br/&gt;systems developed with industry leading to new products, companies, and jobs; integration of&lt;br/&gt;innovation in multidisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students; broadening&lt;br/&gt;participation in power engineering through integrated research activities for K-12 teachers and&lt;br/&gt;students; and improved faculty and graduate student skills in mentoring minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
