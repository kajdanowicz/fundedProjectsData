<AbstractNarration>Computational data science is at a turning point in its history. Never before has there been such a challenge to meet the growing demands of digital computing, to fund infrastructure and attract diverse, trained personnel to the field. The methods and technologies that define this evolving field are central to modern science. In fact, advanced methods of computational and data-enabled discovery have become so pervasive that they are referred to as paradigm shifts in the conduct of science. A goal of this Project is to increase digital science literacy and raise awareness about the Centrality of Advanced Digitally ENabled Science (CADENS) in the discovery process. Digitally enabled scientific investigations often result in a treasure trove of data used for analysis. This project leverages these valuable resources to generate insightful visualizations that provide the core of a series of science education outreach programs targeted to the broad public, educational and professional communities. From the deep well of discoveries generated at the frontiers of advanced digitally enabled scientific investigation, this project will produce and disseminate a body of data visualizations and scalable media products that demonstrate advanced scientific methods. In the process, these outreach programs will give audiences a whole new look at the world around them. The project calls for the production and evaluation of two principal initiatives. The first initiative, HR (high-resolution) Science, centers on the production and distribution of three ultra-high-resolution digital films to be premiered at giant screen full-dome theaters; these programs will be scaled for wide distribution to smaller theaters and include supplemental educator guides. The second initiative, Virtual Universe, includes a series of nine high-definition (HD) documentary programs. Both initiatives will produce and feature data visualizations and the CADENS narratives to support an integrated set of digital media products. The packaged outreach programs will be promoted and made available to millions through established global distribution channels. Expanding access to data visualization is an essential component of the Project. Through a call for participation (CFP), the Project provides new opportunities for researchers to work with the project team and technical staff for the purpose of creating and broadly distributing large-scale data visualizations in various formats and resolutions. The project will feature these compelling, informative visualizations in the outreach programs described above. A Science Advisory Committee will participate in the CFP science selections and advise the Project team. The project calls for an independent Program Evaluation and Assessment Plan (PEAP) to iteratively review visualizations and the outreach programs that will target broad, diverse audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project launches an expansive outreach effort to increase digital science literacy and to convey forefront scientific research while expanding researchers access to data visualization. The project leverages and integrates disparate visualization efforts to create a new optimized large-scale workflow for high-resolution museum displays and broad public venues. The PEAP evaluations will measure progress toward project goals and will reveal new information about visualization's effectiveness to move a field forward and to develop effective outreach models. The project specifically targets broad audiences in places where they seek high-quality encounters with science: at museums, universities, K-16 schools, and the web. This distribution effort includes creating and widely disseminating the project outreach programs and supplemental educator guides. The project visualizations, program components, HD documentaries, educational and evaluation materials will be promoted, distributed and made freely available for academic, educational and promotional use. Dissemination strategies include proactively distributing to rural portable theaters, 4K television, professional associations, educators, decision-makers, and conferences. To help address the critical challenge of attracting women and underrepresented minorities to STEM fields, the Project will support a Broadening Participation in Visualization workshop and will leverage successful XSEDE/Blue Waters mechanisms to recruit under-represented faculty and students at minority-serving and majority-serving institutions and to disseminate the Project programs and materials among diverse institutions and communities.</AbstractNarration>
