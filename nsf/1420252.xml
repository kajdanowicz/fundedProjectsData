<AbstractNarration>The investigators will build and study an electronic, tablet-based teaching portfolio system that can be used to assess middle school science instruction and teachers. The tablet system will contain examples of instructional materials, student work, quizzes, and audio and video taken from classrooms. Teachers will be able to annotate the materials that they include in their electronic teaching portfolios. An electronic portfolio enables a comprehensive set of measures and evidence of teacher effectiveness, including the use of  multi-media, something non-electronic portfolios cannot do.  The tablet system is expected to become a more effective system for the assessment of teaching when compared to non-electronic forms of portfolios and labor intensive classroom observations.  In addition, the electronic portfolio will have the added benefit of promoting teacher professional learning.  These outcomes mean more efficient, ongoing, and better documented teaching assessment.  The system will be consistent with the priorities established in the Next Generation Science Standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will partner with the Los Angeles Unified School District in piloting the tablet with 40 volunteer teachers. Data on student outcomes, teacher knowledge, and teaching practice will be used to cross validate the tablet measures. Quantitative measures will be enhanced by a set of interviews with teachers. In addition to publications, the investigators will make all of the materials, including source code and measures, available as open source on the web.</AbstractNarration>
