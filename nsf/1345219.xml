<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, North Carolina State University will continue to develop the Computational Center for Fundamental and Applied Science and Education.  The vision of the Computational Center is to lead the University?s transformation into a research intensive university with established Ph.D. programs across STEM disciplines. Project objectives are to leverage the successes of Phase I effort to establish a nationally recognized research facility with outstanding scientific and educational programs centered on active collaborations with academia, industry, government and international partners. This objective will be achieved by advancing cross-disciplinary, integrated research, educational, and outreach programs, to meet a confluence of needs in computational science and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The Center will include sustainable, nationally recognized, computationally driven research programs across four areas: (1) development of novel nanomaterials and application of these materials in advanced optoelectronic devices; (2) low-to-medium-energy nuclear and hypernuclear few-body physics; (3) Intelligent systems and robotics; and (4) geophysical characterization of intraplate seismic zones. The center builds on the complementary and closely interwoven research and extensive collaborations established in Phase I.  The computational structures developed by the Center will result in significant new contributions in all of the four research areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The Center has already significantly enhanced the STEM research and education capacities at North Carolina Central University, and is now leading the transformation of the institution to a research oriented institution. The Phase II Center will broaden the educational and research infrastructure to enable the expansion of Ph.D. programs in STEM disciplines.   Center activities include: a) improved STEM matriculation and graduation, especially among African-American students, women, and socially and economically disadvantaged students; b) establishment of Ph.D. programs in STEM disciplines; c) improved STEM undergraduate and graduate curriculum; d) STEM graduates trained in fields critically needed by industry; and e) greater awareness of applied computational sciences among middle and high school students and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
