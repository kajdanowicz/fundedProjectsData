<AbstractNarration>1435957&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;Payne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to integrate advances in biotechnology and microelectronics by developing generic, biologically-based thin film fabrication methods to incorporate biological function into electronics.  Thin hydrogel films will be triggered to self-assemble in response to locally-imposed electrical signals.  The PIs propose methods to incorporate small molecules, proteins, and cells into the hydrogel films, and will focus on understanding how fabrication conditions control the structure-property-function relations. A multilayer thin film system is proposed that will allow communication between the biology and the electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is potentially transformative in four ways. First, the PIs will apply the advances in biology as an underpinning for materials science. Second, theory and experiments will be coupled to characterize the mesoscale self-assembly of soft matter. Third, the spatial, temporal and quantitative precision of electrical signals will be used to create structure, confer properties and perform functions. Finally, the biotechnology and electronics will be integrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong international collaborations are proposed which will provide students with opportunities to participate in projects that span continents and cultures.  The proposed collaboration with industrial partners will accelerate the incorporation of biology into materials science. The PIs also propose to integrate the activities within existing University partnerships with Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Science and Technology. Because they provide the metrology and regulatory guidelines, these agencies will be integral to the speed that biologically-based materials are introduced into the marketplace. These partnerships will assist in accelerating translation and also in providing meaningful externships for students.</AbstractNarration>
