<AbstractNarration>The proposal was submitted to the ship operations program requesting funds to carry out 163 operational days in 2012 aboard the R/V Thomas G. Thompson in support of NSF peer-reviewed sea-going programs. The projected 2012 total number of funded days from all agencies is 277 days, of which 267 days will be days at sea. R/V Thompson will be operating in the Western Pacific off the Mariana&lt;br/&gt;Trench and Forearc for two consecutive MG &amp; G programs, one utilizing the deep-towed sonar system (IMI-120) and a second operating in conjunction with R/V Marcus Langseth for an OBS active and passive source seismic project. Since submission of this proposal, R/V Thompson was able to divert their transit between Apra, Guam and San Diego into Honolulu in order to accommodate two stranded NSF&lt;br/&gt;projects. These cruises had previously been scheduled on R/V Kilo Moana but following a significant hull compromise a rapid response was required in order to support the cruises within the original project scope. The first cruise for Julian Sachs will&lt;br/&gt;conduct a marine diatom experiment. The second cruise for Zackary Johnson, represents a two day add-on to the transit where he plans to collect biological sampling ahead of his 2013 cruises. R/V Thompson will work south of San Diego in the Oxygen&lt;br/&gt;Deficient Waters off the Eastern Tropical North Pacific for Allan Devol. This cruise has a UW student component, where the University has contributed 12 days of institutional funds to augment the cruise. The second half of 2012, R/V Thompson will be operating&lt;br/&gt;in the Pacific Northwest, in and out of home port supporting NSF work for Cascadia, ODP hydrogeology of Juan De Fuca using borehole network and Jason, CORKS and development of a high speed optical communication system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic vessels, operated by the UNOLS academic institutions and funded by NSF, and &lt;br/&gt;other agencies, have been the traditional multi-use facilities required to expand human &lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the ocean environment. These ships working from the ocean's surface &lt;br/&gt;complemented by human-occupied, robotic and more recently -- autonomous undersea vehicles &lt;br/&gt;and sensors, along with aircraft and satellites, continue to provide vital tools in our understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the role of the oceans in determining our climate and in studying and accessing the living and &lt;br/&gt;non-living resources of the world?s seas and sea-beds. &lt;br/&gt;Proper stewardship over ocean resources and their wise use, and decision making for future &lt;br/&gt;ocean- and coastal- related issues are inconceivable without an interested and engaged citizenry: &lt;br/&gt;In addition to technology, our national ocean endeavor requires technical support in the form of &lt;br/&gt;expert human resources, with sound science, mathematics and technical education:  a critical &lt;br/&gt;mass of individuals who will collect and analyze tomorrow's data, and design the tools, models &lt;br/&gt;and applications we will require.  Provision of these sea-going research and educational facilities &lt;br/&gt;enables marine scientists and students from the University of Washington and other institutions &lt;br/&gt;nationwide to study natural phenomena  and to instruct the future scientists and stewards of our &lt;br/&gt;marine ecosystems  on board state-of-the-art oceanographic research vessels complete with &lt;br/&gt;laboratories, sensors, analytical equipment, communications to shore-side investigators and &lt;br/&gt;educators, and full life support for extended missions.  Essential to our mission is the provision &lt;br/&gt;of educational opportunities both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational &lt;br/&gt;outreach programs such as REVEL, Teacher at Sea, to K through 12th grade students, &lt;br/&gt;nationwide.  Periodically, The University held open houses and outreach events to provide a &lt;br/&gt;learning experience for local students including tours through the ship facilities and hands-on &lt;br/&gt;demonstrations of marine science research guided by faculty, students and ships? crewmembers.  &lt;br/&gt;In 2011, the School of Oceanography hosted the International Research Ship Operators &lt;br/&gt;conference at UW.  During the conference, participants enjoyed the opportunity to tour and ride &lt;br/&gt;onboard for a lunch cruise from the Seattle waterfront, through the Ballard Locks, to the &lt;br/&gt;Oceanography Dock.  The University of Washington, with the support of the National Science &lt;br/&gt;Foundation and with coordination by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, &lt;br/&gt;remains dedicated to, and focused upon, furthering mankind's understanding of the world ocean, &lt;br/&gt;the living and non-living resources therein, and their interactions with the approximately fifty &lt;br/&gt;percent of our citizens who live within fifty miles of the shoreline.</AbstractNarration>
