<AbstractNarration>Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Oregon State University propose to support technical services for research on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy. Healy is a research icebreaker operated by USCG in collaboration with NSF and other agencies that fund research in the Arctic. SIO and OSU will provide or coordinate the long-term maintenance and improvements to science systems onboard. They will provide technicians to operate scientific instruments and data systems on the Healy. They will arrange the use of items from the shared-use pools of science vans, coring equipment and other pooled equipment that is part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). SIO will provide one full-time person to act as a cruise planner and to coordinate the research needs for all cruises on Healy. The awardee will maintain updated content on the website http://icefloe.net. As needed the awardees will also assist the Arctic Sciences Section with coordinating science cruises on other national icebreakers to ensure safe and efficient operations. SIO and OSU will provide many coordination services including working with the USCG to perform upgrades to the ship for science and working with USCG and other ships operating in the Arctic to coordinate bathymetric mapping to ensure the most efficient and complete coverage is obtained each year to contribute to a more complete mapping of the Arctic Ocean, which is largely uncharted. Pending availability of funds, several system upgrades may be funded including the addition of a shallow-water multi-beam sonar for collecting bathymetric data in parallel with the existing multi-beam system that performs best in deep water. Each year of this five-year award will be funded based on the planned work at the start of each Arctic field season.</AbstractNarration>
