<AbstractNarration>The Interdisciplinary Mathematics Preparation and Career Training (IMPACT) Postdoctoral Program in the School of Mathematics at Georgia Tech (GT Math) addresses the critical transition from graduate student to tenure-track faculty.  In terms of research expectations, teaching responsibilities, and professional commitments, the postgraduate years are one of the most crucial junctures in the academic career path.  The IMPACT Program addresses these challenges through clearly-defined objectives and well-structured activities to expand research horizons, enhance teaching effectiveness, and advance professional development.  A key component uniting all three goals is an interdisciplinary summer REU program with local partner institutions Spelman, Morehouse, and Agnes Scott Colleges and Georgia State University. A critical mass of postdoctoral fellows is an essential prerequisite, precluding any sense of research isolation and providing significant opportunities for group and peer as well as individual mentoring. Hence, 8 IMPACT Fellows will be recruited in 3 cohort groups centered around the following "Math+X" research themes: (1) Applied &amp; Computational Mathematics plus Computational Science &amp; Engineering (2014 - 2017); (2) Discrete Mathematics plus Molecular Biology (2015 - 2018); and (3) Analysis plus Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering (2016 - 2019). Through this innovative interdisciplinary research cohort model, and with the support of mentored career training, IMPACT Fellows will be well-prepared for the challenges faced by new faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GT Math IMPACT Postdoctoral Program has two innovative features: (1) an interdisciplinary focus on formal research mentoring and (2) highly structured career mentoring and professional development. Preparing new mathematics PhD's for an interdisciplinary research career aligns with increasing recognition of the value in engaging with other STEM disciplines.  The interdisciplinary research program will broaden the intellectual horizons of cohort postdocs, GT Math faculty and graduate students, and Math+X REU participants.  The complementary career training brings best practices for STEM postdoctoral mentoring and new faculty development into action in mathematics, adapting them to the unique circumstances of the field.  The formal structures developed will serve as a national model for the mathematics community. In this way, the IMPACT Program will have a profound "ripple effect" on local and national scales.</AbstractNarration>
