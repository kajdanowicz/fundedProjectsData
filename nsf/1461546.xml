    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of pre-college and undergraduate research and educational experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and locally relevant research is an important step in graduating students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Navajo Technical University Pathways to STEM Careers Project is designed to strengthen the university's E-Learning capabilities by: providing resources to deliver such instruction; developing a pre-engineering certificate and curriculum designed for such instruction, to enable American Indian students from remote areas and high schools in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado to pursue engineering studies; providing an academic ladder to an engineering degree for those students; and researching the effectiveness of E-Learning with Navajo, Pueblo, and Ute students. The project also provides resources to engage engineering students at Navajo Technical University, working with professional support, with students working toward the pre-engineering certificate.</AbstractNarration>
