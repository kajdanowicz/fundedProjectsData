<AbstractNarration>In this project Tennessee Technological University (TTU) provides Robert Noyce Scholarships to 24 students majoring in physics, chemistry, mathematics, and various engineering disciplines so that they can take education courses in their undergraduate years and complete additional courses after receiving their STEM degree in order to qualify for licensure to teach secondary school science or mathematics.  With a total of up to three years of support, students engage in an early teaching experience, are supported and mentored as they obtain their STEM degree and licensure, and are assisted into the transition into the teaching profession during their induction year.  With over 2,300 STEM majors and an updated teacher education program, TTU is well placed to contribute to the need for well trained secondary school science teachers.  Collaborators in the project include the Colleges of Arts and Science, Engineering, and Education; the Center for the Teaching and Learning of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; and several local education authorities.  This pathway to licensure appeals to STEM majors and provides an opportunity to conduct education research identifying best practices in their training.  It also enhances the infrastructure for education in the Upper Cumberland region and makes the STEM departments at TTU stakeholders in the quality of teacher education.</AbstractNarration>
