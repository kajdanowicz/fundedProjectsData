<AbstractNarration>The Noyce Teacher-Leaders for Western Kansas project is developing STEM teachers for rural communities. STEM teachers in a rural western Kansas school are frequently considered the science and mathematics expert in both the school system and the community. Therefore, the project is not only developing quality STEM teachers who are providing needed services to small size communities, such as teaching AP or distance courses, but also developing quality leaders for communities. Through a dual degree program, in addition to completing the requirements for a STEM major at Fort Hays State University (FHSU), the Noyce Teacher-Leaders also complete an education degree, allowing these students to be highly qualified teachers within their discipline. They are being prepared to teach in a rural setting, teach Advanced Placement courses, and deliver distance education. Noyce Teacher-Leaders are also engaged in field experiences in rural high-needs districts. The project provides critically needed support for 18 future STEM teachers during their junior and senior years and resources to recruit freshmen and sophomore STEM students through participation in informal summer science and mathematics camps (6 each in summers 1-4). Mentoring and professional development opportunities support Noyce Teacher-Leaders in remote rural areas. The project offers a model for recruitment, retention and preparation of STEM teachers working in rural districts. The model has broad impact on the region because with good teacher-leaders comes the reward of a new generation of students with interests in STEM fields. The major intellectual merit is in the model for identifying and developing critical thinking skills, attributes, and characteristics for STEM educators in high needs rural districts and a model for building sustainable partnerships over a large geographic region.</AbstractNarration>
